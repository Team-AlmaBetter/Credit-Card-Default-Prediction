# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
The primary origin of a credit card related risk for banks is client default, which is the inability to reimburse a debt. A default can happen when a borrower cannot make convenient payments, misses payments, or dodges or quits making payments. In the case of credit cards, no assets are securing the debt, but the lender still has legal recourse in the event of default. Credit card corporations regularly give a few months before an account goes into default. However, if after 6Â months or more there have been no installments, the account will get feed off, meaning the lender takes a loss on the account. Consecutive missed payments for credit card debt are an early sign of customer bankruptcy.
Therefore, banks must have a risk prediction model and be able to classify the most relative characteristics that are indicative of people who have a higher probability of default on credit. With the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, classification, and regression models are being utilized to predict credit risk. A small increase in the accuracy of identifying high-risk credits could prevent losses of millions of dollars.
